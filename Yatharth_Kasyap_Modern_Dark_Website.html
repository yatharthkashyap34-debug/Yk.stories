<h2>Chapter 1: The Night the Monster Woke</h2>
<p>Rain fell like broken glass on the rooftops of Raigarh — a sleepy town where time moved slowly and silence held secrets like scars. In a crumbling house on the edge of Shivnagar Lane, a boy sat cross-legged on the cold cement floor, sketching a crooked tree in his notebook. His name was Rahul. Ten years old. Thin. Quiet. Eyes too old for his age. He had been that way for as long as he could remember.</p>
<p>The tree he was drawing had no leaves. Only branches that twisted like veins through empty sky. The roots clung desperately to cracked ground, the way he clung to his notebook — the only thing in his life that never yelled at him. The room around him smelled of burnt rice and stale alcohol. The corners were full of shadows that even daylight refused to touch. A single bulb hung from the ceiling, flickering in tired spasms.</p>
<p>From the other side of the house came familiar sounds: voices raised, furniture shifting, glass breaking. The nightly ritual.</p>
<p>... (full story continues as provided) ...</p>
<p>The monster had woken.<br>And it had chosen a name.</p>
